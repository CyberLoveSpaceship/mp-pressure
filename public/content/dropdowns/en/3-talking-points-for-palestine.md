heading: Talking points for Palestine
---

- Mention that you’re a constituent/taxpayer (icky language but it makes them value what you’re saying)
- Talk about your personal experience (how it has impacted your day-to-day, etc.)
- We’ve been watching the Canadian government and are ashamed to call them our government
- They’ve voted against Palestine 150 times at the UN in the past decade, which makes it clear that their priority is in their military relationship to the Israeli apartheid state, not in justice/stopping ethnic cleansing
- Israel’s denial of food, water, power, and medicine; combined with the merciless attacks on hospitals, schools, homes, and civilians; is beyond criminal and this occupation must be stopped immediately.
- We don’t want our government on the wrong side of history
- Have a call(s) to action:
- As a constituent/taxpayer/etc., I’m asking you to advocate for a ceasefire immediately
- Guarantee access for humanitarian aid to Gaza
- If you’re comfortable, ask them what they’ve already done to take action against the ongoing genocide
- If they reply and you’re not sure what to say, you can thank them for answering your question and reiterate that everything you’ve learned, including what they’ve told you, does not justify ethnic cleansing/genocide

## Tips

- If you ask a question, they’re more likely to respond beyond a confirmation of receipt. Example: Would you be able to explain how my tax dollars are going to Israel?

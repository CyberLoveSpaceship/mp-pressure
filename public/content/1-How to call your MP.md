## On the phone

- Introduce yourself and identify yourself as a constituent by providing your postal code or address.
- Ask to speak to the MP directly, but do not be surprised if you must speak to the MP’s staff instead. Staff can help move your issue forward.
- Give the reason for your call and explain your concern.
- Focus on one or two main concerns per phone call. Do not unload on the MP or their staff with all of your political concerns at one time.
- Ask clear and pointed questions that require some explanation.
- Ask for a commitment to action.

## Tips for Calling MPs 

- Tell the MP that this issue will matter to you in the next election.
- Avoid revealing party affiliation or sympathies. If you show that your vote is already cast for a certain party, the MP may not have the incentive to respond to your requests.
- Be as brief as possible while outlining concerns. Show that you respect their time.
- Remain calm and respectful in dialogue. Be willing to work with them.
- Follow up: Find out what actions were taken as a result of your call, and respond appropriately.
